						<p>Demi Lovato is never not changing up her hair. From <a href="#">purple to blue</a> to turquoise, she's tried (and totally pulled off) it all. But one thing that stays constant—and constantly on-point—is the singer's makeup game. Which is why it was only a matter of time until she landed her very own beauty deal.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>Today it was announced that Demi will be the first-ever brand ambassador of N.Y.C. New York Color, AKA the drugstore favorite we have to thank/blame for those 99-cent nail polishes we can't stop buying, among lots of other budget-friendly buys.</p>
				<p>As the official face of the brand, Demi will be repping them on social media (including behind-the-scenes glimpses at campaign shoots!). Plus, kicking off in early 2015, she'll start popping up in their advertisements—so keep an eye out!</p>
				<p>In case you've lost track, this latest partnership is on the heels of a bunch of other major beauty collabs for the style icon. In addition to being able to snag Demi-approved skincareand hair extensions, we can now get our hands on her favorite makeup, too. If we could just get a step-by-step breakdown about how to effectively steal her always-flawless smoky eye, then we'd really be set.</p>
